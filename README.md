# mautrix-imessage-nosip
A Matrix-iMessage puppeting bridge for Macs with SIP disabled.

This will supersede [mautrix-imessage](https://github.com/mautrix/imessage) for
the SIP-disabled use case and will feature more integration with Barcelona.
No changes have been made yet, so use mautrix-imessage for now.
Android SMS and SIP-enabled iMessage will remain in the original project.
